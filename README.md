## Installation
The way you need to make this work is to make sure you have pygame installed correctly.<br>
Before you install, make sure python is installed to your machine by using the command:<br>
`python --version`<br>
If a message like "Python 3.8.10" appears then you have python installed correctly.<br>
If an error occurs go to the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) <br>
and follow the instructions to properly install python.<br>
<br>
Once it is installed you need to see if pip is installed correctly and you do that by typing this command:<br>
`pip --version`<br>
If a message such as "pip 20.0.0 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)" appears, you are<br>
ready to install pygame. Run this command to install it:<br>
`pip install pygame`

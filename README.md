# pychess
The only way you need to make this work is to make sure you have pygame installed correctly. 
Before you install, make sure python is installed to your machine by using the command:
`python --version`
If a message like "Python 3.8.10" appears then you have python installed correctly.
If an error occurs go to the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
and follow the instructions to properly install python.

Once it is installed you need to see if pip is installed correctly and you do that by typing this command:
`pip --version`
If a message such as "pip 20.0.0 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)" appears, you are
ready to install pygame. Run this command to install it:
`pip install pygame`
